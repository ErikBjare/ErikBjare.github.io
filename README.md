# Blog

The blog is mostly old stuff I wrote, nowadays I tend to write wikipages instead since they don't come with deadlines and can be continual works in progress.

# Wiki

## Metadata structure

**NOTE:** This is a plan for a metadata structure, not in use at the moment.

Each wiki page can have a few metadata fields (or tags with prefixes, i.e. `confidence-low`) such as:

 - `tags`, a list of space-separated tags.
 - `confidence`, taken from [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags).
 - `importance`, also taken from [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#importance-tags).
 - `state` (needs a better name), indicates the current state of the article. Can be one of:
   - early
   - mature
   - (more might be needed)

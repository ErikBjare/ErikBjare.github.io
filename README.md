==================

My personal website, currently two parts: A wiki and a blog.

# Wiki

Here I write about anything that interests me. I'm currently working towards [improving organization of the articles](https://github.com/ErikBjare/ErikBjare.github.io/issues/3) by introducing useful metadata.

# Blog

The blog is mostly old stuff I wrote, nowadays I tend to write wikipages instead since they don't come with deadlines and can be continual works in progress (removing publication pressure).

# I'm hiring!

I'm looking for help with a variety of open source projects, and as an experiment offer compensation for your contributions. Compensation is offered by time spent (tracked with ActivityWatch). 

The jobs available are generally programming-related, but I might expand this to non-technical tasks in the future.

Salary is negotiable, but expect a range of â‚¬20-50/h (depending on skill and difficulty of task).

**Note:** This is in an early experimental stage, feedback and ideas welcome!

### Prerequisites

What I expect from you:

 - You can work largely independently and don't need much supervision (except for more difficult tasks).
 - You have previous experience with the programming language you'll be working in.

I consider it a bonus if you:

 - You have a history of contributing to open source projects that I can review.
 - You've previously contributed to the project or worked with me before.


### How it works

Before getting started, contact me by email with the following brief information:

 - A link to your GitHub profile
 - One or two past contributions you want to show off (if we haven't worked together before)
 - Your expectations regarding pay.

Then we'll discuss terms. 

Feel free to start working without my permission (in fact, I encourage you to!).


### Getting paid

Once your work is done, I need a few things from you so you can get paid:

 - Matching ActivityWatch events (using [this script](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client/blob/master/examples/working_hours.py))
 - (optional) Manually tracked time (using something like Toggl)
 - An invoice payable by SEPA transfer, or a receiving ETH address.

You are responsible for paying taxes on the income you get.

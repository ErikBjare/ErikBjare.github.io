# I'm hiring!

I'm looking for help with a variety of open source projects, and as an experiment offer compensation for your contributions. Compensation is offered by time spent (tracked with ActivityWatch). 

The jobs available are generally programming-related, but I might expand this to non-technical tasks in the future.

Salary is negotiable, but expect a range of â‚¬20-50/h (depending on skill and difficulty of task).

**Note:** This is in an early experimental stage, feedback and ideas welcome!


### Available jobs

Currently there are jobs available on the following projects:

 - [ActivityWatch][gh-aw]
 - [Chatalysis][gh-chatalysis]
 - Projects related to [my MSc Thesis][gh-thesis]

The specific tasks available in each projects can vary from time to time, and I haven't yet compiled a list of suitable tasks you can work on, but contact me and I'll see if there's something suitable for you.

Is the specific thing you're interested in working on not listed? I'm open to suggestions!

[gh-aw]: https://github.com/ActivityWatch/activitywatch
[gh-chatalysis]: https://github.com/ErikBjare/chatalysis
[gh-thesis]: https://github.com/ErikBjare/thesis


### Prerequisites

What I expect from you:

 - You can work largely independently and don't need much supervision (except for more difficult tasks).
 - You have previous experience with the programming language you'll be working in.

I consider it a bonus if you:

 - You have a history of contributing to open source projects that I can review.
 - You've previously contributed to the project or worked with me before.


### How it works

Before getting started, contact me and we'll discuss terms.


### Getting paid

Once your work is done, I need a few things from you so you can get paid:

 - Matching ActivityWatch events (using [this script](https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client/blob/master/examples/working_hours.py"))
 - (optional) Manually tracked time (using something like Toggl)
 - An invoice payable by SEPA transfer, or a receiving ETH address.

You are responsible for paying taxes on the income you get.


### Past jobs

Nothing here yet, but in the future I'll list people who've worked for me and links to some select contributions they made.

            <h3>My Past</h3>

                <h5>I once was a kid you know</h5>
                When I about 5 years old, my uncle Wolf who worked for Apple at the time got
                my family our first home computer apart from my dads work laptop, an
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3">iMac G3</a>. Shortly after my other uncle
                Arne, developer of Sweden's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Action">first
                commercial videogame</a>, got us a few games to play, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Racer">Star Wars Racer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmageddon_II:_Carpocalypse_Now">Carmageddon II</a>.

                <h5>"OMG, Broadband!"</h5>
                A few months into kindergarten I found out that one of my new found friends
                had this amazing thing called broadband which gave you UNLIMITED access to
                the internet without having to dial up! I thought this was the coolest thing
                as I had been playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Shockwave">Shockwave</a> games but with a time-restraint set by my parents.
                I barely remember Netscape, but I'm fairly sure I used it back then.

                <h5>A short tale of admins with redskulls and the demise of Onyxia</h5>
                So, in 3rd or 4th grade something interesting happened, there was this online MMORPG called Tibia which me, my friends,
                and pretty much every computer-game playing student on the entire school played it. 
                <br><span style="color: red">[In Progress]</span>
                <!-- ToDo: Add stuff about the OT server and WoW private server -->

                <h5>Bitcoin is here! (also known as the "It's raining money!" era)</h5>
                Somewhere in the beginning of 2011 I first found out about Bitcoin and I was thrilled about the
                possibilities that came along with it. Naturally, I began mining them. After a month
                or so I started thinking about expanding my mining operation, being 16 and financially
                responsible I decided that I could afford to risk 1500 SEK for a Radeon HD5850, so I bought one.
                So I had managed to accumulate a double-digit amount of Bitcoin over a few months mining off and on.
                <br><br>
                But then in May 2011 something interesting happened, the price rose by 3200% in 7 weeks. I was a part of the original insane speculative Bitcoin bubble, and I (like everyone else) went completely nuts (after all, we were going to the <b>MOON!</b>). But I managed to sell my double-digit amount of bitcoin at $28, not a bad deal, right?
                Well, if you've seen the price lately you know that, in hindsight, it was a sort of a bad move. A few weeks later I accidentally short-circuited my HD5850 (Whoever decided it was a good idea to put metal flaps on SATA connectors, I'll find you).
                <br>But I'm not mad, after all, I'm lucky to even have had the opportunity to miss out on ~$50000.
                <br><br>
                In early June 2012 I started writing a small Bitcoin-trader that profited on simple
                spread trading on the Swedish Bitcoin market Kapiton. The investment was small and
                so was the profit due to relatively high fees on the market (1.35%) but in the end I
                think I made ~50$ over a couple of months on a 150$ investment, not bad. But the
                golden days didn't last long, the spread narrowed and the profits went down to
                levels that simply weren't worth my time and development halted entirely in early
                July since I was working at a corrugated fiberboard factory over the last 4 weeks of
                summer break. Then school resumed and development didn't really resume until a few
                weeks later, when the bot hadn't been running for several weeks and I found that
                the spread was once again large enough to make a significant profit, I once again
                started trading with the bot and made small upgrades and fixes when I had the time.
                <br><span style="color: red">[In Progress]</span>

                <h5>Blown away by rationality</h5>
                I had for the past couple of years read some of the writings of <a href="http://gwern.net/">Gwern</a> 
                and had occationally stumbled upon some of his posts on the site <a href="http://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>.
                Unfortunately I had not payed the community much attention when the occational link led 
                me there but around the end of 2013 I began reading the <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences">Sequences</a> 
                and was completely blown away by what I was reading.
                <br><br>
                I had all my life been trying to be rational (despite friends and family with 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLgNZ9aTEwc">The Straw Vulcan</a> view of rationality 
                occationally challenging my belief in it), but I had never gotten exposed to the kind of content 
                that the people at LessWrong were contributing.

I stumbled upon this image one day <!-- today --> and found it pretty interesting as it relates to an idea I've had myself: How could open source software make ordinary users/[useds][useds] into superusers who can easily and effectively control the software they use, and therefore their own life. All without being an experienced programmer with a lot of free time.

I especially found these points insightful:

 - What you read
   - Logging could be known with ActivityWatch + kindle mod
   - For most people, what you read is [largely decided by social media][ors]
 - Articles and books you write
   - Logging could be done with [ActivityWatch][aw]
 - What skills you learn
   - See [KnowTree][knowtree]
 - What you buy
   - See [Thankful][thankful]

This worries me. 

Honestly, it has always worried me (and I'm not too keen on worrying). When I was young I heard about how the Roman empire, the "cradle of civilization", in the end went up in flames. How? Why? What went wrong?

<!-- It had been the questions that scholars and historians have asked for centuries yet they seemed so detached to our modern life's. How was *that* meaningfully similar to what he have *now*? Something similar to those events could never happen today, right?

## Background

I had an idea about how we might want to concern ourselves with the speed and direction of our now fast-moving culture (as affected by media, social or otherwise). 

Then I searched for it, and lo and behold the concept was at its core nothing new: http://www.cbc-network.org/2008/01/cultural-velocity/

>To forget our nature as finite human creatures is foolish. This intense cultural velocity, powered by the excess of modern technology, simply cannot go on forever. In ignoring ethical guides and boundaries in the pursuit of longer, better, more full-of-stuff lives, we certainly cut ourselves off, defeating ourselves from the very beginning. This race isn’t a sprint. It’s a marathon, to be run with perseverance and virtuous direction.

To answer those last questions:

 - If I had the time to answer that question I wouldn't be writing this article.
 - Yes
 - No
 - No
 - Yes

Sometimes I think: I'm guilty of not being able to slow down.

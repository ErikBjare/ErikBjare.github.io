So, you are one of those people who get a lot of ideas? Lucky you. As I've understood it, most people don't.

Now, there are a few tricks for the less fortunate of us, but if you aren't thinking of whatever you are truly interested in thinking about you are likely to not get very far. If you do think a lot however, there are a few things you could do in order to get more and better ideas.

Some people have a naive view of how to get ideas. Things like "just take a room and put a lot of smart people in it and brainstorm!" are definately not how most great ideas are born. Linus Torvalds once put it brilliantly in the law he introduced as "Linus' Law" explaining the three primary reasons 'hackers' do things, out of neccesity/survival, for social reasons, or simply for the fun of it. It might strike you that the motivatory power behind these are listen in increasing order, but if you can hit all three, you're golden. If you put a bunch of "smart people" in a room you won't get any good ideas for many reasons, first of all their brains wouldn't be geniunely motivated to do the things brains do when they come up with ideas and second of all most ideas just come at the strangest of moments, in the shower, while running, walking your dog, being frustrated about a suboptimal service and the list goes on...

First off, whenever you get an idea, write it down, write it _all_ down until you have no idea what more to write. This step is crucial in order for you to not only get more ideas, but get _good_ ones. Perhaps you have built up a nice collection of >20 ideas, only some of which are good, others which might be good with some work, and others which you realize will never work (at least not with less than $1m funding). This is okay, in fact, I think this is normal.

Whenever I get ideas, it's because I see something that is suboptimal or an area with a lot of low hanging fruit.

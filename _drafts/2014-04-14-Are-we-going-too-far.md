When I was in 9th grade I read a fascinating article in the paper that questioned an old dogma, wether students should be able to grade their teachers, and I instantly (before having read anything but the header) realized the issues that would entail. Students not behaving appropriately towards a teacher in a possibly anonymous survey as well as imposing a non-standard performance measurement for teachers. Another issue would be that students grade the teacher badly [for getting bad grades](http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/students-get-revenge-for-bad-grades/). There will always be some students in a class with good grades however, who's incentive to unjustly grade the teacher will be 
Still, if teachers get bad scores from students across the board, chances are something is wrong. And highly-rated teachers might be able to help the lower-rated ones. The concerns about unfair ratings by students would surely be overlooked by a decent principal. It would also make sense for student feedback (which is really a better word than grading) to be anonymous for the receiving teacher but that the identity can be found out by a third party as to prevent unfair 'revenge grading'.

This method can propagate in other areas as well, the ratings of managers, politicians could all be useful ratings to have. But it could seemingly be used in most organizational structures, hierarchical or not. The internal politics of the system would have to be very carefully shaped by it's functionality however to prevent misuse and non-constructive criticism. 

But quantifying each other has another reason, [link](http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/04/17/the-quantified-other-nest-and-fitbit-chase-a-lucrative-side-business/). ToDo.

And the answer to the original question is...
Nope, we've got a long way to go before we got what we came for. We just have to make sure we won't be forced to return empty handed.

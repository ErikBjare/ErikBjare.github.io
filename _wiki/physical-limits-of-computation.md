There are several works of science fiction containing a trope of a universe-wide computer as the end-game of galactic civilization ([Multivac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivac) etc). But what would the upper bound for the computing power of such a computer be?


In Joe Armstrongs 2013 talk "The Mess We're In" he introduced me to some answers to this question (at 26:26). See the video and links at the bottom for more info.

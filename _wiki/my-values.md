 - Atheist/agnostic
 - Effective Altruism
 - Far-future outcomes

I once has a discussion with a friend where I argues for the existance of a, currently unknown, universal value function (such that it accounts for all good and bad in the world). This might not be a very appealing idea to people not interested in effective altruism, but to me it's of great interest to speculate in what such a universal value function would look like, regardless if it actually ends up being a good idea or not.

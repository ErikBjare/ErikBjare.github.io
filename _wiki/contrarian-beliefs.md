Sometimes I find myself having a belief that is not (yet) mainstream, or is otherwise unorthodox. Unfortunately I'm pretty bad at writing them down or otherwise acknowledging when a belief is contrarian, but here goes nothing. 

 - Many types of ads could be replaced by user controlled recommendation systems. 
 - Ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in market cap.
   - I was a bit overly optimistic on *when* this would happen, as can be seen in this [Metaculus question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/471/will-the-market-cap-of-ether-be-higher-than-that-of-bitcoin-by-2020/) I created.

## Important subjects

 - Meta
   - Why write publicly about these things?
     - Primarily due to rolemodels like Gwern, Eliezer, etc.
 - Longevity
   - Is Longevity research an effectively altruistic action?
   - Gwern has done an analysis of the [cost-effectiveness of life extension](https://www.gwern.net/Longevity).
 - Nootropics
   - We have to do the best we can with the machine we have (our brains) until we can create something better (BCIs?)
 - The end of Moores law / The far-future of computing
   - The way forward: Memristors, quantum computing?
   - What are the consequences if we've really reached the end? How long do we expect it to last?
 - Self-management
   - Valves model
     - The Valve Handbook for New Employees (2012): http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf
     - Gabe Newell comments (2017): https://youtu.be/YpaNnX_9Q5s?t=3m8s
   - Why don't more companies use this model?
     - Maybe because it's difficult for most people to work within this model. Requires self-driven individuals.
 - AI
   - Andrew Ng thinks there wont be another AI winter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc
   - How do we deal with job displacement? Andrew Ng comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc&t=1h5m20s
 - Computer Interaction in the Future
   - VR/AR
     - Might warrant an article in itself
   - The issue of computer-human bandwidth
   - Brain-Computer Interfaces
 - Future of Education
   - Should governments incentivize learning by paying the unemployed to go to school?
   - Will MOOCs ever reach maturity?
     - Maybe with the help of government sponsoring
 - Future of Personal Data
   - Security concerns
   - Should we use something like Syncthing to provide sync and git to provide integrity/versioning?
   - How do we deal with data generated/stored by social media services? Can we extract it?
 - Open sourcing everything
   - What could other fields learn? Why is open source so successful in software development but not in other areas?
   - Does Open Hardware have a future, and if so, when?
     - Likely when barrier to getting custom PCBs/circuits is lowered significantly
 - Simulation hypothesis
   - The question if we're in a simulation is not really that interesting due to the sheer difficulty of the question. A much more interesting question would be if we could simulate a (micro)universe ourselves.
   - What room is there for optimization? Are suns millions of lightyears away really having all their particles simulated?
 - Cryptocurrency
   - How will/should governments deal with it?
 - How to capture created value in open source (how to make a profit writing open source software)
   - We have workable solutions for enterprise software, but not very good ones for consumer/user-centered software.

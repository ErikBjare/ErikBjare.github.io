Long Software (similar to [Long Content](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content)) is software that lasts and remain in use a long time.

One of the best examples of this is Unix tooling which has been around since the 70s. While the original code might not still be in use, the fundamentals of the software have remained largely unchanged, the parts that have changed have largely been additions and not fundamental changes in the design. 

Software that lasts is usually (but not always) [good software](/wiki/good-software).

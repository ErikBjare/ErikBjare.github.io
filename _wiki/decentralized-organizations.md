This article is intended to be a braindump of thoughts about decentralized/flat/self-organising organizations. It is in large part inspired by open source projects and the Valve Employee Handbook.

## Examples

 - Valve (see the [Valve Employees Handbook](https://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf))
   - As [Hampus Jakobsson](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/hampus-jakobsson) wrote when it came up in conversation: *"Valve-style is a bit of a mythical dream. I think I need to see 5+ companies successfully implementing it before I'd believe it's replicable"* (translated from Swedish)
 - Open source projects

## Management

 - If a product-person has an idea and needs engineers to build it, they need to convince the engineers to join themselves. 
   - This seems to be what happens inside Valve according to the Employee Handbook.
   - Eric Schmidt called it "Bottom-up ideas, top-down decision making" in [Masters of Scale #6 with Eric Schmidt](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/masters-of-scale/e/51210068) @ 20:30

## Decision making

 - Futarchy

## Funding

 - DAO's and DAC's

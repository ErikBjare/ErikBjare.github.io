Recommendation systems are all around us:

 - Ads
 - Search results
 - Your social media feeds

## Why care? 

They control a large part of your life. Which articles you read (and which you don't), which ads you get served, and which search results are deemed relevant for you.

It seems the the Internet has been pretty polarising, if we could pop more <!-- Bad term --> "search bubbles". We'd probably be less ignorant about everyone else's position on issues for instance and would be more likely to interact online on with better understanding for each others position. 

 - Essentially, by controlling the algorithm we would have the freedom to decide how we want to communicate [(free as in freedom)](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) 


## The Benefits of Customization

Here I will explain the value of having a personal recommendation system that is customizable.

When we go on Facebook or any other social media site, we are at their algorithms mercy... 

We need experimentation and analysis to recommendation models to measure what their biases and click-through rates are. But what we need is experimentation. 
It would enable us to configure it in ways that self-controlled systems usually aren't. 

### This cause has no enemies, only people who ignore it

Social Media has had a remarkable impact on society. There have certainly been positive effects, the breaking down of barriers and vastly decreased friction in communication and networking. 

What we want is to be able to research ourselves a better future, and for that we have to work together in an as transparent manner as practical. Unfortunately this transparency stands in some opposition the the practical thing at Facebook for example. The currently popular social media networks are all for-profit, with the usual associated pros and cons when it comes to incentive.

What I want is for this debate to start and the research to happen. I think it is extremely important. 


### The Dangers of Black Box Recommendation

AI is, in a way, potentially a threat to us in some ways already today.  (No wonder Mark Zuckerberg defends it.)

I really want to stress the impact this has on people's life.

### Personal Improvement

I sometimes joke that humans are terrible people who are trying to do best they can. We have a lot of problems, but we want to solve them and do try to (one after another). Sometimes we are selfish, and solve problems for us by creating problems for others, but that's for another time.

The information you consume controls you. Yet most people have a questionable information diet (I include myself here). These habits are reinforced by recommendation systems, and can therefore tend to bring out the worst in us. Someone at Facebook with access to the relevant data [might know stuff about this (Add link to Facebook studies where they did research on people running the engine)], but they sure aren't telling us about it.

## OMG, another use case for ActivityWatch

So, after writing quite a bit here I just realized we could collect click-data and measure engagement time per link in a personal feed.


## Feature ideas

 - Offer a the platform black box models as systems to use some of the time. Analyze the results.
 - Offer a view that presents a community-collected "public" database of votes.
    - Could be created from the public data of reddit, HN and Twitter as examples. Even combine/weight them. The most wanted will prevail.
 - Degrees-of-separation to interactor (interactor that votes/likes/comments) for weighting recommendations based on the connectome of the social graph. 
    - This could be immensely powerful protection against true shills, since they'd need to infiltrate the social graph. 
 - We could implement combined views by filtering/sampling of sources and combinating them. 
   - This seems like a good way to think about it, for me at least.


## Name for software

 - PersonalFeed? 
   - Taken?
      - Doesn't seem to be. 
   - Domain?

## Am I crazy or right?

The craziest of the crazy ideas end up being those that turn out to be right against consensus/the status quo/. Because, in hindsight, it turns out it was not the idea that was crazy, it was us for believing so.

Not sure if I'm right but it's pretty damn crazy if true. 

This is why this is a draft. Careful criticism appreciated.

# Value Proposition

There is a lot of discussion in the Quantified Self movement about the actual value of self-tracking/logging and it seems many have grown skeptical about its value over time.

I will probably write about my own thoughts on this someday, but to summarize: I find it fun and rewarding, keeping a history of what I've been doing is important to me so that I can look back and have a less biased view of my past.


# Automatic

## Computer Activity

 - Active window/website
   - RescueTime 
   - ActivityWatch
 - Active file in text editor
   - WakaTime
   - ActivityWatch extension possible using existing WakaTime plugins
 - Input activity
   - ActivityWatch (currently only for AFK detection) 
   - ulogme (keypresses) 
   - Selfspy (full keylogger) 

<!-- TODO: Refer to feature comparison in the ActivityWatch README. -->

## Location

 - Google Maps Timeline / Google Location History
 - Moves

## Fitness

 - Fitness trackers
   - Mi Band 2 (cheap, recommended, my current one) 
   - Mi Band (even cheaper, much better 30-60 day battery)
   - Fitbit (Flex was my first one, the 5 day battery was annoying after a while) 

## Sleep

 - Currently tracking with Mi Band 2, acceptable accuracy but not great.


# Manual logging

During my first year of university (2013) I did extensive manual logging in a spreadsheet. It worked really well and it was pretty detailed (including mood + productivity 3x daily, sleep, exercise, etc.). I kept it up for months and it's one of the most important logging experiences I've had, the spreadsheet format is great for most manual logging (apart from things like diaries).

## Issues

 - Takes effort

## Benefits

 - Enables logging of a lot of data otherwise unrecordable. 

## Subjective measures

 - Mood
 - Productivity
   - Could be worth more than objective measurements in some aspects.
   - Highly correlated with mood in my findings (as expected, but interesting nonetheless). 

## Drugs/Pharmaceuticals

 - Recreational drugs (alcohol, etc.)
   - A great way to keep track of consumption patterns and tolerance. 
   - I believe this greatly improves self-control of consumption (due to the increased awareness of consumption patterns).
   - Definitely recommended.
 - Pharmaceuticals and supplements
   - Valuable medical data. Good for reference. 


# Privacy

The best argument for not logging everything is the risk of compromising very personal information. I therefore don't use things like keyloggers but plan to use keycounters.
